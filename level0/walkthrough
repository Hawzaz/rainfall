We see that the program waits for an argument, but we don't know which one, so
we go in gdb and tries to disassemble it 

0x08048ed9 <+25>:	cmp    eax,0x1a7 

this line deserves our attention, its the one causing a SIGSEGV without
arguments. We see thath it compares eax to 0x1a7 (423)

Lets try to give 423 as an argument to use in atoi, bingo !
We now have a shell in level1 permissions :)

Last thing we need to do is cat /home/user/level1/.pass, got the flag ! :)
