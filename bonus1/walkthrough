By doing the source code and reading it we can see that the binary is using the first argument
which will be multiplied by 4 to copy the second argument in the buffer. The first argument 
shouldnt be greater than 10 but we need it to be = to 1464814662 (0x574f4c46) in order to use the execl

We will use a buffer overflow in order to reach the good value.
By testing the different value we can look at the max uint which is 4294967295 (0xffffffff)

4294967295 / 4 = 1073741823

Now if we put this in negative, and multiply it by 4 we can actually overflow and pass the condition (<10)

But we must reach the 0x574f4c46 == condition

46 4c 4f 57 = FLOW in ascii (funny hehe)

if we manage to overflow by 4 the buffer of 40 character we can achieve it, so now we will look
for what number * 4 = 44 with a big negative value

We find that -1073741813 * 4 = 44

So we need this and 44 charcacters but the 4 lasts must be FLOW

./bonus1 -1073741813 aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaFLOW

Here we are :)
